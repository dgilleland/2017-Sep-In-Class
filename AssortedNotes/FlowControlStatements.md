## Do-While

```csharp
do
  statementOrStatementBlock
while(conditionalExpression);
```

**The key point to remember about the `do-while` statement is that the decision to repeat happens *after* the body of the loop. This means that the repeating logic occurs at least *once*.**

- `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a single C# statement, or a set of statements enclosed inside of a **statement block** `{  }`
- `conditionalExpression` is any expression involving variables, values, and arithmetic/relational/logical operations *as long as the final data type is a **boolean**.*

## While

```csharp
while(conditionalExpression)
  statementOrStatementBlock
```

**The key point to remember about the `while` statement is that the decision to repeat happens *before* the body of the loop. This means that the repeating logic occurs at least *zero times*.**

- `statementOrStatementBlock` is either a single C# statement, or a set of statements enclosed inside of a **statement block** `{  }`
- `conditionalExpression` is any expression involving variables, values, and arithmetic/relational/logical operations *as long as the final data type is a **boolean**.*
